### EDA of COVID Cases in COnnecticut. Looking for Distribution and Spread of Deaths by Month as the pandemic progressed.

This report examines different measures of spread to assess the variability and distribution of COVID-19 data in Connecticut from April 2020 to June 2022. Measures such as range, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, and coefficient of variation were utilized to understand how the data points vary from the central tendency, with particular focus on COVID-19 cases, tests, and deaths. The dataset, which includes 102,245 rows and 16 columns, underwent preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for analysis using Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Seaborn. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to summarize and visualize the distribution of the data, focusing on the spread of total cases and confirmed deaths across different towns and dates.

The analysis revealed significant skewness in the data, particularly in total cases and confirmed deaths, with distributions heavily skewed towards lower values. By examining the five-number summary, mean, and standard deviation, the study identified patterns in the data, such as higher case numbers during certain timeframes. Visualizations like bar plots and line plots further illustrated the relationship between total cases and deaths over time, highlighting potential influences of external factors like vaccine availability and lockdowns. These insights suggest that further analysis could incorporate these external variables to better understand their impact on COVID-19 trends in Connecticut.
